<h4>
    <strong>Intensive Method </strong>
</h4>
<p>
    <strong>In case of irrigated sowing:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Around 97% of the total wheat area is irrigated but assured irrigation is available
    in small area. Hence improved varieties should be selected and used after understanding
    how the yield of wheat can be increased by use of limited resources of irrigation
    and fertilizers.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Preparation of field </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Mostly wheat is sown after paddy hence sowing of wheat is often delayed. We should
    decide in advance as to what variety of paddy should be selected in Kharif and what
    variety of wheat can be sown in Rabi. To get good yield of wheat planting of paddy
    in time is essential so that the field is vacant in the month of October. Secondly,
    it is also note worthy that the soil becomes hard after paddling in paddy. It will
    be suitable to plough twice by disc harrow to convert the soil into fine tilth after
    plough by rotavator. By use of disc harrow the remains of paddy is cut into small
    pieces. Spread 15-20kgs nitrogen (in the form of urea) per hectare at the time of
    first plough for preparation of field to allow the crop remains to rot. By use of
    tractor driven rotavator, the field is fully prepared by single plough.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Sowing</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Wheat should be sown in time when there is sufficient moisture. Late ripening variety
    must be sown in time otherwise the yield will be reduced. As the sowing becomes
    delayed, rate of reduction in yield of wheat is also declined proportionately. If
    the wheat is sown in December, yield is reduced by 3-4 quintal per hectare and if
    it is sown in January, the yield is reduced at the rate of 4-5 quintal per hectare
    per week. By sowing wheat using seed drill, fertilizer and seed can be saved.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Seed Rate and Seed Treatment </strong>
</p>
<p>
    In case of line sowing use 100kg seed in normal condition and 125kg per hectare
    seed if the grains are bold. In broadcasting method, 125kg normal grain and 150kg
    per hectare bold grain should be used. Check the germination rate before sowing.
    This facility is available free of cost at state research centers. If the germination
    capacity is low, increase the seed rate accordingly. If the certified seed is not
    available, seed treatment is essential. Sow the seed after treatment with carboxine,
    azatobactor and PSB. In the areas of limited irrigation, use 75kg normal grain and
    100kg bold grain per hectare when the seed is sown by raised bed method.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Distance between rows </strong>
</p>
<p>
    18-20cm in normal condition and 5cm deep.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>In case of late sowing</strong>
</p>
<p>
    15-18cm and 4cm deep.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Method </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Sow the seeds in furrows through ferti seed drill when the moisture is sufficient
    in the field. Sowing after irrigation is better. It should be taken care that there
    must be 400-500 plants with streak otherwise the yield will be adversely affected.
    To avoid delay, sow Pant nagar zero till seed by fertilizer drill. Sowing by tractor
    driven roto till drill is more beneficial. Sow the seeds without plough in Bundelkhand
    (Mar and kawar soil) so that the germination is good.
</p>
<h4>
    <strong>Bed Planting </strong>
</h4>
<p>
    By this technique, the field is prepared by traditional method and bed is prepared
    for planting. In this method, a special machine called bed planter is used to make
    furrows and sowing. The furrows are also used for water drainage. On a bed, the
    wheat is planted in 2 or3 rows. The farmer can save seed, fertilizer and water and
    take good yield in this method. The wheat crop can be sown as mixed crop with sugarcane
    crop. The soil for sowing should be in the form of fine tilth and there should be
    sufficient moisture for good germination. The characteristics features and benefits
    of this method are as follows:</p>
<div class="number-list bott_margin">
    <ul>
        <li>Approximately 25% seed can be saved in this method. It means 30-32 kg seed is sufficient
            for 1 acre.</li>
        <li>This machine prepares the bed of 70 cm on which the wheat can be planted in 2-3
            rows. For better germination, seed should be placed at a depth of 4-5 cm.</li>
        <li>The bed should be in north-south direction so that every plant can get direct sun
            light.</li>
        <li>The cost of this machine is approximately Rs.70, 000.</li>
        <li>25-40% water requirement is less in this method. If there is in sufficient moisture
            in the field, irrigate the field within 5 day of sowing.</li>
        <li class="lastli">In this method, approximately 25% nitrogen is saved.120 kg Nitrogen,
            60 kg Phosphorous and 4o kg potash per hectare is sufficient. </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p>
    <strong>Crop diversification by Bed Planting</strong></p>
<p>
    Crop of moong, maize, soyabean, arhar and cotton can be grown immediately after
    wheat. This method results 15-20% more yield of pulses and oilseeds.</p>
<h4>
    <strong>Use of Fertilizers</strong></h4>
<p>
    <strong>A. Quantity</strong>
</p>
<p>
    It is better to use fertilizer on the basis of soil testing report. To get good
    yield of dwarf variety of wheat after the crop of maize, paddy, jowar, bajra in
    Kharif, use at the rate of 120:60:40 kg per hectare and in case of late sowing,
    80: 40:30 nitrogen, phosphorous and potash respectively. In Bundelkhand region,
    use of nitrogen, phosphorous and potash at the rate of in120: 60:40 kg per hectare
    respectively and 30 kg sulphur per hectare has been found beneficial in normal condition.
    In the areas where DAP is being continuously used, use of 30 kg sulphur would be
    beneficial. If the field was left vacant in Kharif or pulses were grown, use 20
    kg less nitrogen per hectare. Use 60 quintal farm yard manure for good yield. It
    helps in maintaining soil fertility.
</p>
<p>
    In continuous crop cycle of paddy-wheat area, the yield of wheat starts declining.
    Hence, use green manure between harvesting of wheat crop and planting of paddy or
    use 10-12 ton per hectare farm yard manure in paddy crop. Now a day, deficiency
    of zinc is often seen. The symptom of deficiency of zinc appears in the plant between
    20-30 days of sowing which are as follows:
</p>
<div class="mini-list bott_margin">
    <ul>
        <li>The infected plants remain dwarf in comparison to healthy plants. </li>
        <li>The base of the leaves turns yellow from the lower side and grows upward. </li>
        <li class="lastLi">After some time, brown spot appears on the leaves. </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p>
    If the symptom of deficiency of zinc appears in standing crop, spray 5 kg zinc sulphate
    and 15 kg urea dissolved in 800 liter water per hectare. If the top dressing of
    urea is already done, spray zinc sulphate dissolved in 2.5 kg lime water in place
    of urea (dissolve 2.5 kg quick lime in 10 liter water in the evening and filter
    it in the morning and use filtered water and through away the lime).Please note
    that it is essential to use urea or lime water with zinc sulphate. If zinc sulphate
    has not been used in paddy field as basal dressing and there is possibility of deficiency,
    top dress with 20-25 kg zinc sulphate.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>B. Time and Method</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Use fertilizer in following manner in different types of soil to increase the fertilizer
    capacity:
</p>
<div class="number-list bott_margin">
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Loam or Matyar, Kawar and Mar </strong>
            <br>
            Half of the quantity of nitrogen and full quantity of phosphate and potash should
            be given 2-3 cm below the seeds in the furrows and remaining quantity of nitrogen
            should be given before 2 hours of first irrigation.</li>
        <li class="lastli">In sandy, loam,rakad and padwa sandy clay,1/3rd quantity of nitrogen
            and full quantity of phosphate and potash should be given below the seeds in the
            furrows. Half of the remaining quantity should be given after first irrigation9
            after 20-25 days of sowing at crown root initiation stage) and the remaining quantity
            after second irrigation. In these type of soils, top dressing after irrigation is
            beneficial. Where only 40 kg full quantity of phosphate and potash should be given
            nitrogen and 2 irrigation is possible, place the whole quantity of nitrogen at the
            time of sowing in heavy loam soil but in case of light loam soil, place half of
            the quantity of nitrogen in the furrows at the time of sowing and top dress with
            the remaining quantity at the time of first irrigation. </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<h4>
    <strong>Irrigation</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    <strong>A. In case of Assured Irrigation </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>1. Normal Condition: </strong>Irrigation should be done in light soil in
    following stages to get optimum yield from dwarf variety of wheat. Deficiency of
    water at these stages adversely affects the yield heavily but give light irrigation.

<p>
    <strong>2.</strong> A. In loam or heavy loam soil, 4 times irrigation can result
    good yield but the irrigation should be 8 cm deep.
</p><div class="mini-list bott_margin">
    <ul>
        <li>First irrigation after 20-25 days of sowing.</li>
        <li>Second irrigation after 30 days of first irrigation.</li>

        <li class="lastLi">Fourth irrigation after 20-25 days of third irrigation.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p>
    <strong>B. In case of limited irrigation resources </strong>
</p>
<p>
    If only three irrigations are possible, first irrigation should be given at crown
    root initiation stage, second at jointing stage and third at milk stage. If two
    irrigations are available, first irrigation should be given at crown root initiation
    stage and second at flowering stage. If only one irrigation is possible, it should
    be given at crown root initiation stage.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Please pay attention to following three points in irrigation of wheat:</strong></p>
<div class="number-list bott_margin">
    <ul>
        <li>Level the field well before sowing and make a slope in any one direction so that
            the water can be uniformly distributed in the whole field.</li>
        <li>Divide the field in required size according to the type of soil in the field and
            means of irrigation after sowing. It helps in distribution of water at a time.</li>
        <li class="lastli">In case of assured irrigation, light irrigation (approximately 6
            cm deep) in light soil and in case of loam and heavy soil where irrigation facility
            is available, heavy irrigation ( 8 cm deep) should be done. </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p>
    <strong>C. In case of irrigation and late sowing</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Wheat is sown after aghani paddy, toria, potato, ratoon of sugarcane and early ripening
    variety of arhar but yield in this area can also be increased to some extent by
    following techniques of agriculture research:</p>
<div class="mini-list bott_margin">
    <ul>
        <li>Select the variety according to seasonal adoptability for late variety which has
            already been described.</li>
        <li>In case of late sowing, use zero trill age machines for sowing.</li>
        <li>Use seed at the rate of 125 kg per hectare and fertilizer in balanced quantity (80:40:30).</li>
        <li>Soak the seed for 24 hours in water, allow germinating and sowing when the moisture
            is sufficient.</li>
        <li class="lastLi">Late sown wheat crop requires frequent irrigation as compared to
            normal crop. Do first irrigation after 15-20 days of germination and top dress.
            Then irrigate at an interval of 15-20 days. Water should be available in sufficient
            quantity at the time of streak formation and milk stage. Deficiency of water at
            this stage will adversely affect the yield. Do light irrigation. Adopt other cultivation
            activity like irrigated wheat. </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<h4>
    <strong>Cultivation of wheat in non irrigated and rain fed condition</strong></h4>
<p>
    In the state, approximately 10% area of wheat is non-irrigated where yield is very
    low. The yield of this area reduces the average yield of the state. Experiment reveals
    that cultivation of rye, barley and gram is more beneficial than wheat in rain fed
    conditions. In such conditions, sow wheat in October when there is sufficient moisture.
    But if there is sufficient rain in the month of October-November, wheat can be sown
    by adopting following technique:</p>
<h4>
    <strong>Time of Sowing</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    Sow at the time of sufficient moisture, the recommended variety between second fortnight
    of October to first fortnight of November.</p>
<h4>
    <strong>Seed Rate and distance between rows </strong>
</h4>
<p>
    Use seed at the rate of 100 kg per hectare and sow the seed in furrows at a distance
    of 23 cm in such a way the soil above the seed is not more than 4-5 cm.
