<p>
    Out  of  about  141  m.Ha  of  net  area  sown  in  the  country,  about  65  million  hectare  (or  45%)  is  presently  covered  under  irrigation.    Substantial  dependency  on  rainfall  makes  cultivation  in  unirrigated  areas  a  high  risk,  less  productive  profession.  Empirical  evidences  suggest  that  assured  or  protective  irrigation  encourages  farmers  to  invest  more  in  farming  technology  and  inputs  leading  to  productivity enhancement and increased farm income.
</p>
<p>
    The overreaching vision of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY)  is to ensure  access  to some  means  of  protective  irrigation  to  all  agricultural  farms in the country, to produce ‘per drop more crop’, thus bringing much desired  rural prosperity.
</p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
<p>The broad objectives of PMKSY include</p>
<ul>
    <li>Achieve   convergence   of   investments   in   irrigation   at   the   field   level  (preparation  of  district  level  and,  if  required,  sub  district  level  water  use  plans).</li>
    <li>Enhance  the  physical  access  of  water  on  the  farm  and  expand  cultivable  area under assured irrigation (Har Khet ko pani).</li>
    <li>Integration of water source, distribution and its efficient use, to make best  use of water through appropriate technologies and practices. </li>
    <li>Improve  on - farm  water  use  efficiency  to  reduce  wastage  and  increase  availability both in duration and extent.</li>
    <li>Enhance   the   adoption   of   precision - irrigation   and   other   water   saving  technologies (More crop per drop).</li>
    <li>Enhance recharge of aquifers and introduce sustainable water conservation  practices. </li>
    <li>Ensure  the  integrated  development  of  rainfed  areas  using  the  watershed  approach  towards  soil  and  water  conservation,  regeneration  of  ground  water,   arresting   runoff,   providing   livelihood   options   and   other   NRM  activities. </li>
    <li>Promote    extension    activities    relating    to    water    harvesting,    water  management  and  crop  alignment  for  farmers  and  grass  root  level  field  functionaries.</li>
    <li>Explore  the  feasibility  of  reusing  treated  municipal  waste  water  for  peri - urban agriculture.</li>
    <li>Attract greater private  investments in irrigation. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Programme implementation</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Krishi Sinchayee Yojana with an outlay of Rs.50,000 crores for a period of 5 years (2015-16 to 2019-20) is to achieve convergence of investments in irrigation at the field level. </li>
    <li>PMKSY has been formulated amalgamating ongoing schemes viz. Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (AIBP) of Ministry of Water Resources, River Development &amp; Ganga Rejuvenation; Integrated Watershed Management Programme (IWMP) of Department of Land Resources; and On Farm Water Management (OFWM) component of National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA) of Department of Agriculture and Cooperation.</li>
    <li>PMKSY is to be implemented in an area development approach, adopting decentralized state level planning and projectised execution, allowing the states to draw their irrigation development plans based on district/blocks plans with a horizon of 5 to 7 years. States can take up projects based on the District/State Irrigation Plan. </li>
    <li>All the States and Union Territories including North Eastern States are covered under the programme.</li>
    <li>The National Steering Committee (NSC) of PMKSY under the chairmanship of Hon’ble Prime Minister, will provide policy direction to programme framework and a National Executive Committee (NEC) under the chairmanship of Vice Chairman of NITI Aayog will oversee the programme implementation at national level. </li>
    <li>Provision has been made under PMKSY during 2015-16 for carrying out extension activities in the field with special focus on water harvesting, water management and crop alignment for farmers and grass root level field functionaries. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Programme Components</h3>
<p>PMKSY has the following programme components:</p>
<p><b>A.  Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (AIBP) </b></p>
<ul>
    <li>To  focus  on  faster  completion  of  ongoing  Major  and  Medium  Irrigation  including National Projects. </li>
</ul>
<b>B.  PMKSY (Har Khet ko Pani) </b>
<ul>
    <li>Creation  of  new  water  sources  through  Minor  Irrigation  (both  surface  and  ground water) </li>
    <li>Repair,  restoration  and renovation  of  water  bodies;  strengthening carrying  capacity  of  traditional  water  sources,    construction  rain  water  harvesting  structures (Jal Sanchay); </li>
    <li>Command  area  development,  strengthening  and  creation  of  distribution  network from source to the farm; </li>
    <li>Ground water development in the areas where it is abundant, so that sink  is created to store runoff/ flood water during peak rainy season. </li>
    <li>Improvement  in  water  management  and  distribution  system for  water  bodies to take advantage of the available source which is not tapped to its  fullest capacity (deriving benefits from low hanging fruits). At least 10% of  the command area to be covered under micro/precision irrigation. </li>
    <li>Diversion  of  water  from  source  of  different  location  where  it  is  plenty  to  nearby water scarce areas, lift irrigation from water bodies/rivers at lower  elevation   to   supplement   requirements   beyond   IWMP   and   MGNREGS  irrespective of irrigation command. </li>
    <li>Creating and rejuvenating traditional water storage systems like Jal Mandir  (Gujarat);  Khatri, Kuhl (H.P.); Zabo (Nagaland); Eri, Ooranis (T.N.); Dongs  (Assam); Katas, Bandhas (Odisha and M.P.) etc. at feasible locations. </li>
