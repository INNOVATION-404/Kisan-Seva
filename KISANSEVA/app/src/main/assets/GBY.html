<h3>Background on RKVY</h3>
<p>Concerned by the slow growth in the Agriculture and allied sectors, the National Development Council (NDC), in its meeting held on 29th May, 2007 resolved that a special Additional Central Assistance Scheme (RKVY) be launched. The NDC resolved that agricultural development strategies must be reoriented to meet the needs of farmers and called upon the Central and State governments to evolve a strategy to rejuvenate agriculture. The NDC reaffirmed its commitment to achieve 4 per cent annual growth in the agricultural sector during the 11th plan.&nbsp;<strong> </strong></p>
<p>The Department of Agriculture, in compliance of the above resolution and in consultation with the Planning Commission, has prepared the guidelines for the RKVY scheme, to be known as <strong>National Agriculture Development Programme</strong> (RKVY).</p>
<h3>Objectives of the programme</h3>
<ul>
    <li>To incentivize the states that increase their investment in Agriculture and allied sectors</li>
    <li>To provide flexibility and autonomy to the States in planning and executing programmes for agriculture</li>
    <li>To ensure the preparation of Agriculture Plans for the districts and states</li>
    <li>To achieve the goal of reducing the yield gaps in important crops</li>
    <li>To maximize returns to the farmers</li>
    <li>To address the agriculture and allied sectors in an integrated manner</li>
</ul>
<h3>Basic features of RKVY</h3>
<ul>
    <li>It is a State Plan scheme</li>
    <li>The eligibility of a state for the RKVY is contingent upon the state maintaining or increasing the State Plan expenditure for Agricultural and Allied sectors</li>
    <li>The base line expenditure is determined based on the average expenditure incurred by the State Government during the three years prior to the previous year. </li>
    <li>The preparation of the district and State Agriculture Plans is mandatory</li>
    <li>The scheme encourages convergence with other programmes such as NREGS. </li>
    <li>The pattern of funding is 100% Central Government Grant. </li>
    <li>If the state lowers its investment in the subsequent years, and goes out of the RKVY basket, then the balance resources for completing the projects already commenced would have to be committed by the states.</li>
    <li>It is an incentive scheme, hence allocations are not automatic</li>
    <li>It will integrate agriculture and allied sectors comprehensively</li>
    <li> It will give high levels of flexibility to the states </li>
    <li>Projects with definite time-lines are highly encouraged </li>
</ul>
