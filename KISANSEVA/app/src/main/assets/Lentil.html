    <strong>Land</strong></p>
<p>
    Soil heavier than loam is suitable for its cultivation. Masoor is especially sown
    in the field lying vacant after harvesting paddy.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Preparation of Land</strong></p>
<p>
    First plough should be done by disc harrow and subsequent 2 â€“ 3 plough by local
    plough followed by leveler.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Time of Sowing</strong>
</p>
<p>
    For timely sowing mid October to mid November and in case of late sowing December
    first week is suitable time. Sowing of Masoor by Pant Nagar Zero Till Seed Drill
    is more beneficial.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Seed Rate </strong>
</p>
<p>
For timely sowing 30-40 kg and late sowing 40-50 kg seed is sufficient.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Seed Treatment</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Sow 10 kg seed of masoor after treatment with 1 packet of rhizobium leguminoserum
    culture especially in those field in which masoor has not been sown earlier. Treat
    the seed after chemical treatment.PSB must be used.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Fertilizer </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Use 20 kg nitrogen, 60 kg phosphorous,20 kg potash and 20 kg sulphur per hectare
    in normal sowing. In Uttera method of sowing, top dress with 20 kg nitrogen after
    harvesting of paddy and spray 30 kg phosphorous twice at the time of flowering and
    pod formation.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Irrigation </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Apply first irrigation before flowering. If there is no rain in the crop sown in
    paddy field, apply second irrigation at the time of pod formation.

    <strong>(A) Main Insect</strong>
</p>
<div class="number-list">
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Mahu </strong>
            <br>
            The infant and adults of this insect sucks the juice of leaves, stems and pods and
            weaken them. The insect secretes honey on which black mould grows which hinders
            the photosynthesis.</li>
        <li><strong>Semilooper Insect</strong>
            <br>
            The maggot of this insect is green in color which moves in loop. The maggots eat
            leaves, soft twigs, buds, flowers and pod and harm it. </li>
        <li class="lastli"><strong>Pod Borer Insect </strong>
            <br>
            The maggots of this insect enter the pod by boring it and eat the grain inside.
            In case of intense menace, the pods become hollow and production falls. </li>
    </ul>

    <strong>Control Measures</strong>
</p>
<div class="number-list">
    <ul>
        <li>Sow in time.</li>
        <li class="lastli">If the insect menace has crossed economic loss level, use any one
            of the following insecticides:-</li>
        <ul>
            <li>For control of mahu insect in standing crop, spray dimethoate 30% EC or methyl-O-
                dematon 25% EC 1.0 liter or monochrotofos 36% solution 750 ml per hectare dissolved
                in 500-600 liter water. Azadirechtin (Neem Oil) 0.15% EC, 2.5 liter per hectare
                can also be used.</li>
            <li class="lastli">For control of pod borer insect and semilooper insect, spray any
                one of the following bio/chemical insecticides or dissolved it in 500-600 liter
                water and spray it:-</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Bacillus thuringeansis(BT)- Kirstkey variety 1.0 kg </li>

<p>
    Keep watch on the field. Spray at an interval of 15 days if needed. Do not repeat
    an insecticide.

<p>
    <strong>(B) Critical Disease</strong></p>
<div class="number-list">
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Root Rot </strong>
            <br>
            The plant starts drying after 15-20 days of sowing. If the plant is uprooted and
            seen, fungus like cotton is found stick around the stem. </li>
        <li><strong>Ukatha </strong>
            <br>
            The plants slowly start wilting and dry. The bark becomes brown in color and if
            the root is cut vertically, brown colored veins are seen. Ukatha can infest the
            plant at any stage.</li>
        <li class="lastli"><strong>Gerui </strong>
            <br>
            In this disease, orange colored blister is formed on leaves and stem as a result

<div class="number-list">
    <ul>
        <li class="lastli"><strong>Cultivation Activities</strong>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>In summers, plough by disc harrow helps in control of soil borne diseases.</li>
                <li>Do not take the masoor crop in the field for 3-4 years which is often infested by
                    Ukatha.</li>
                <li class="lastli">For protection from Ukatha disease, sow disease resistant variety
                    such as Narendra Masoor-1, Pant Masoor-4, Masoor-5, Priya, Vaibhav etc.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Seed Treatment</strong>
            <br>
            For control of seed borne diseases, sow the seed after treatment with thiram 75%+carbandasim
            50% (2:1) 3.0 gm or trichoderma 4.0 gm per kg seed. </li>
        <li><strong>Soil Treatment </strong>
            <br>
            For control of seed and soil borne diseases, mix the bio pesticides trichoderma
            viridi 1% WP or trichoderma harzianum 2% WP at the rate of 2.5 kg per hectare with
            60-75 kg decomposed dung manure, sprinkle light water on it and keep it for 8-10
            days in the shade. Spread the mixture at the time of last plough before sowing.
            This controls the seed/soil borne diseases in peas.</li>
        <li class="lastli"><strong>Foliar Treatment </strong>
            <br>
            For control Of Gerui disease, spray mancozeb 75% WP 2.0 kg or propiconazole 25%
            EC at the rate of 500 ml per hectare dissolved in approximately 500-600 liter water.</li>

    <strong>(C) Important Weeds</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Bathua, Santhi, Krishna neel, Hiran khuri, chatri-matri, Akra, forest carrot, gajri,
    pyaji, khartua, satyanaashi etc</p>
<p>
    <strong>Control Measure </strong>
</p>
<div class="mini-list">
    <ul>
        <li>For weed control by weed herbicide chemicals, spread in the soil fluchloralin 45%

            sowing or spray pendimethylene 30%, 3.30 liter or alochlor 50% EC uniformly at the
            rate of 4.0 liter per hectare dissolved in water as above through flat fan/nozzle
            within 2-3 days of sowing. </li>
        <li class="lilast">If weed herbicides has not been used, hoe by hand hoe to control
            the weeds.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p>
    <strong>Harvesting and Storage</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Harvest the crop when it is fully ripened. Thresh it in a clean field and take out
    the grains. Use aluminium phosphide at the rate of 3 tablets per ton for protection
    from storage insects.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Important Points </strong>
</p>
<div class="number-list">
    <ul>
        <li>Sow the certified seed timely the recommended for that specific area.</li>
        <li>Seed treatment is essential.</li>
        <li>Use single super phosphate for phosphorous and sulphur.</li>
        <li>Decide the quantity of seed according to the size of kernel and time of sowing.
        </li>
        <li>Disease control in time is essential.</li>
        <li class="lastli">If the germinated seed is sown before 15 days of harvesting of paddy,
            the yield may increase up to 30%.</li>
