    <strong>Barseem </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Barseem is famous as green fodder for milch animal due to its quality. In northern/eastern
    areas it is cultivated successfully after cultivation of maize or paddy.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Land</strong></p>
<p>
    Loam soil is suitable for barseem. Acidic soil is not suitable.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Preparation of Land</strong></p>
<p>
    After Kharif crop, do first plough by disc harrow followed by 2-3 plough by harrow
    to convert the soil into fine tilth. Divide the field into some plots of 4*5 meter.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Sowing time </strong>
</p>
<p>
    It is better to sow from 15th October to 15th November. In case of late sowing,
    number of cutting is reduced and production is adversely affected</p>
<p>
    <strong>Method of sowing</strong></p>
<p>
    Spread the seed in the field filled with 5 cm water. Drain out the water after 2
    hours of sowing. Where the harvesting of paddy is delayed, utera is better. In this
    method, barseem is sown in bed sheet method in standing crop of paddy before 10-15
    days of its harvesting.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Seed Rate </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Sow 25-30 kg of seed per hectare. For more yield of fodder in the first cutting,
    mix 1 kg per hectare T-9 seeds of mustard with barseem and sow afterward.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Harvesting</strong></p>
<p>
    Tillering is better if the crop is cut 8-10 cm above the ground. Leave the crop
    after first cutting if the seed is to be taken.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Seed Treatment </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Often kasni seed is mixed with barseem. If the mixed seed is soaked in 5-10% saline
    solution, the kasni seed floats on the upper surface. Filter it. Take out the barseem
    seed immediately and wash with fresh water.<br>
    If the barseem is sown for the first time in any field, treat the seed with 10%
    barseem culture. After treatment, the seed is mixed with fine soil of the field
    in equal quantity as sown in earlier barseem crop.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Fertilizers</strong></p>
<p>
    At the time of sowing, spray 20 kg of nitrogen and 80 kg of phosphorus per hectare
    of the field and mix it well.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Irrigation</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Apply first irrigation just after germination. Later, irrigate 2-3 times at an interval
    of a week. Other than this, irrigate at an interval of 20 days by the end of February
    and between March to May, irrigate at an interval of 10 days is essential. It is
    important to irrigate every time after harvesting. Water provided must not be more
    than 5cm.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Harvesting</strong></p>
<p>
    Cutting should be done 4-5 times. Cut 5-6 cm above the ground level.

<p>
    <strong>Seed Production</strong></p>
<p>
    Stop cutting after 2-3 cuts. Last week of February or first week of March is better
    for cutting. Do not irrigate after 10-15 days of last cutting. In case of more cutting,
    seed yield is reduced.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Yield</strong></p>
<p>
    Yield of green fodder is 80-100 tons per hectare. After 2-3 cutting, 2-3 quintal
    per hectare seed and 40-50 tons per hectare green fodder can be obtained.
