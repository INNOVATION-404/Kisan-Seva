    </h1>
</head>
<body>
<p>
    This is unfertilized cob of the maize plant which is plucked after 2-3 days of silk
    coming out and used. The baby corn is used in the form of salad, soup, vegetables,
    pickles and candy, pakora, kofta, tikki, burfi, laddoo, halwa, khir etc.</p>
<p>
    The baby corn is a delicious and nutritive diet and free from the effects of insecticides
    as it is covered with leaves. Phoshorous is found in sufficient quantity in baby
    corn. In addition to it, carbohydrate, protein, calcium, iron and vitamins are also
    found in sufficient quantity. Baby corn is low calorie food as it is free of cholesterol
    but have high fiber in abundance which is very useful for heart patients.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Production Technology</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Except number of plants in abundance, higher quantity of nitrogen and early harvesting,
    all other cultivation activities are similar to maize.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Selection of land</strong>
</p>
<p>
    For cultivation of baby corn, loam soil with sufficient biological content is suitable.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Preparation of Field </strong>
</p>
<p>
    First plough should be done by disc harrow and next 2-3 plough by local plough or
    cultivator and use cultivator to prepare the field. Sufficient moisture is essential
    at the time of sowing other wise tillage should be done for preparation of field.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Selection of Variety</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Early ripening, medium height and single hybrid variety are best suited for cultivation
    of baby corn.
</p>
<p>
    Single cross hybrid, early ripening variety in which duration of silk coming out
    is 70-75 days in Kharif, 40-45 days in spring and 120-130 days in winter is suitable.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Sowing Time </strong>
</p>
<p>
    In northern India, baby corn can be sown any time between February to November.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Sowing Method </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Sowing should be done in southern part of bund and distance between bund to bund
    and plant to plant is 60cm x 15 cm.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Seed Rate </strong>
</p>
<p>
    20-25 kg per hectare is suitable according to test weight of hybrid variety.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Quantity of Fertilizer </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Use of 8-10 ton per hectare decomposed dung manure and nitrogen, phosphorous, potash
    and zinc sulphate in the ratio of 150:60:60:25 kg per hectare is essential. In Kharif,
    nitrogen should be used in three parts. Full quantity of phosphorous, potash and
    zinc sulphate and 1/3rd part of nitrogen should be spread in the field at the time
    of sowing, 1/3rd of nitrogen after 25 days of sowing and remaining part of nitrogen
    after 40 days. In Rabi, nitrogen should be used in 4 parts.1/4th part should be
    spread at the time of sowing,1/4th after 30-35 days of sowing,1/4th after 60-80
    days and remaining 1/4th after 80-110 days. In spring season baby corn, 1/4th part
    should be spread at the time of sowing,1/4th after 25 days of sowing,1/4th after
    40-45 days and remaining 1/4th after 60-65 days.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Weed Control</strong>
</p>
<p>
    First weeding and hoeing after 15-20 days after showing, second after 30-35 days
    of sowing must be done which allows air circulation in the roots. The roots spread
    in wider area, collects the food and provide it to the plants. Spray of atrazine
    50% WP at the rate of 1.5 kg per hectare dissolved in 500-600 liter water in the
    field before germination of maize does not allow the weed to grow and maize crop
    grows faster.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Irrigation </strong>
    <br>
    2-3 irrigation is essential as per season and crop. Apply first irrigation after
    20days, second when the plants attain knee height and third before flowering.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Crop Protection</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Baby corn is not affected by disease or insect because it is free from harmful disease
    and insects as its cob is covered with leaves.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Harvesting</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Hand picks the ears of baby corn when it is 3-4 cm long and silky emerges from the
    ear tips. At the time of picking the ears, do not remove the leaves. By removing
    the leaves, it deteriorates very soon. In Kharif, the ears should be picked every
    day and in Rabi, it should be picked at an interval of 1-2 days. In single cross
    hybrid 3-4 hand picking is essential.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Yield </strong>
</p>
<p>
    By cultivation in above manner, an average yield of 15-20 quintal per hectare can
    be obtained. In addition to this, 200-250 quintal per hectare green fodder is also
    obtained.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Inter Cropping</strong>
</p>
<p>
    For green pods and fodder, lobia, urad, moong in Kharif and baby corn in Rabi with
    potato, peas, rajma, methi, coriander, cauli flower, Saljam, radish, carrot etc.
    can be grown as intercrop. For inter crop, additional quantity of fertilizers should
    be used. Thus yield so received from intercrop is an additional benefit.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Economic Benefit</strong>
</p>
<p>
    From single crop of baby corn, Rs. 40000-50000 can be the net income per hectare
    and 3-4 crop can be grown in a year. In this way more income can be earned in less
    time.</p>
<p>
    In big cities of Uttar Pradesh such as Ghaziabad, Bulandshahar, Meerut, Lucknow,
    Kanpur, Varanasi etc., cultivation of baby corn is being done. There is enough possibility
    of cultivation of baby corn in eastern Uttar Pradesh. Farmers, who reside near the
    city, can take more benefit.
