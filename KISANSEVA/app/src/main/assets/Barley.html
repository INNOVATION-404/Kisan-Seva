<p>
    In case of limited resources of irrigation and fertilizers and non-irrigated conditions,
    cultivation of barley is more beneficial than wheat. Following points should be
    taken care to get good yield in irrigated, non-irrigated, late sown and usher land.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Preparation of Field</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Prepare the field by 2-3 plough by local plough or disc harrow.

<p>
    <strong>Sowing Method </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Sow the seeds 5-6 cm in furrows at a distance of 23 cm behind the plough. In non-irrigated
    condition, sow 6-8 cm deep so that sufficient moisture can be available for germination.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Fertilizer</strong>
</p>
<p>
    It is better to use fertilizer on the basis of soil testing.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>A. Non-Irrigated Area </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Spread 40 kg/hectare nitrogen, 20 kg phosphate and 20 kg potash below seeds in the
    furrows. Use of funnel is beneficial for this.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>B. In the stage of timely sowing in irrigated condition. </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Spread 30 kg/hectare nitrogen, 30 kg phosphate and 20 kg potash below seeds in the
    furrows at the time of sowing followed by top dressing of 30 kg nitrogen at the
    time of first irrigation.20-30 kg/hectare sulphur should be used in light soil.
    For better yield, use 40 kg/hectare rot farm yard manure. 25% extra quantity of
    nitrogen should be used for malt variety.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>C. In case of usher and late sowing</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Spread 30 kg/hectare nitrogen and 20 kg phosphate below seeds in the furrows at
    the time of sowing followed by top dressing of 30 kg nitrogen after the time of
    first irrigation. Use 20-25 kg/hectare zinc sulphate in usher land.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Irrigation</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Two Irrigation:</strong>Irrigate after 30-35 days at the time of tillering
    followed by second irrigation at milking stage. If only one time irrigation is available,
    do it at the time of tillering. Cultivation of barley for malt requires an additional
    irrigation. In usher land, 3 irrigation-first at the time of tillering, second at
    the time of joint formation and third at the time of grain formation is required.

    <strong>(A) Critical Insects</strong></p>
<p>
    <strong>Control Measures</strong>
</p>
<div class="number-list bott_margin">
    <ul>
        <li>For termite control before sowing, treat the seed with chlorpyrifos 20% EC or thiomethozam
            30% fs at the rate of 3ml. per kg seed.</li>
        <li>Mix 2.5 kg bio pesticides Beauvaria bassiana 1.5% with 60-75 kg/hectare farm yard
            manure, sprinkle light water on it and keep it in shade for 8-10 days. Mix it in
            the soil before sowing and at the time of last plough. This will control termite
            and soil borne insects.</li>
        <li>Use chlorpyrifos 20% EC at the rate of 2.5 liter per hectare with irrigation water
            for control of termite/weevil in standing crop.</li>
        <li class="lastli">For control of Mahu insect, spray dimethoate 30% EC or methyl-o-dematon
            255 EC at the rte of 1.0 liter per hectare or thiometon 25% EC 1liter dissolved
            in 750 liter water. Azadirechtin (Neem Oil) 0.1% EC at the rate of 2.5 liter per
