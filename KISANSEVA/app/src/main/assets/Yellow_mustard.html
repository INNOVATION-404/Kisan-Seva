        <b> YELLOW MUSTARD</b>
    </h1>
</head>
<body>
<p>
    Yellow mustard is also sown as cash crop like toriya between Rabi and Kharif. Additional
    profit can ne earned by its cultivation.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Preparation of Field</strong></p>
<p>
    First plough is to done by disc harrow followed by 2-3 plough by local plough, cultivator/
    harrow. Use leveler to make the soil fine.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Quantity of Seed</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Use yellow mustard seed at the rate of 4kg/hectare.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Seed Treatment</strong></p>
<p>
    For protection from seed borne diseases, sow the seeds after treatment. Sow the
    seed only after treatment with thiram at the rate of 2.5 gm per kg seed. If thiram
    is not available, treatment with metalaxyl at the rate of 1.5 gm per hectare controls
    the white gerui and tulasita disease in early stage.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Sowing Time </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Yellow mustard should be sown from 15th September to 30th September. To get good
    crop of wheat, yellow mustard should be sown in first fortnight of September when
    the time is available.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Quantity of Fertilizer</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Use fertilizers on the basis of recommendations of soil testing. If soil testing
    is not possible, use fertilizer as follows:</p>
<div class="number-list">
    <ul>
        <li>In non-irrigated area, use 40 kg nitrogen, 30 kg phosphate and 30 kg potash per
            hectare.</li>
        <li class="lastli">In irrigated area, use 80 kg nitrogen, 40 kg phosphate and 40 kg
            potash per hectare. Use of phosphorus as single super phosphate is more beneficial
            because it supplies 12% sulphur. Half of the quantity of nitrogen and full quantity
            of phosphate and potash should be given 2-3 cm below the seeds in furrows by funnel
            (chonga). Remaining quantity of nitrogen should be used at the time of first irrigation
            as top dressing.200 kg gypsum and 40 kg per hectare rot farm yard manure must be
            used for supply of sulphur. </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p>
    <strong>Method of Sowing</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Sowing by local plough is beneficial. Sow 3-4 cm deep at a distance of 30 cm in
    rows and cover the seed by using leveler.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Irrigation</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Rye is more susceptible to the deficiency of moisture at the time of flowering.
    Hence to get good yield, irrigation is essential at this stage. Make proper arrangement
    of water drainage.</p>

    <strong>(A) Critical Insects </strong>
</p>
<div class="number-list">
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ara Fly:</strong>
            <p>
                The larva of this insect is black grey in color which eats the leaves from the sides
                or bores the leaves. In case of intense menace, the whole plant becomes leaf less.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Painted Bug: </strong>
            <p>
                The infant and adults of these insects are spotted and are in black, orange and
                red in color. The infant and adults sucks the juice from leaves, branches, stems
                and fruits. The infested leaves dry from the edges and start falling. Grain formation
                is also adversely affected in infested pods.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Haired larva: </strong>
            <p>
                The larva is black and orange in color and the whole body is covered with hair.
                The larva lives in cluster and eats the leaves. It spreads in the whole field afterwards
                and eats the leaves. . In case of intense menace, the whole plant becomes leaf less.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Mahu: </strong>
            <p>
                The infant and adults of these insects are yellowish green in color that sucks the
                juice of soft stem, leaves, flower and new pods and weakens them. Mahu secrets the
                honey on which black fungus grows which hinders the photosynthesis.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="lastli"><strong>Leaf borer insects: </strong>
            <p>
                The larva of this insect bores the leaves and eats the green part as a result white,
                irregular shaped lines are formed in the leaves.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<strong>Control Measure</strong></p>
<ul class="number-list ">
    <li>Deep plough in summers. </li>
    <li>Use balanced fertilizers. </li>
    <li>Collect the larva of Ara fly in the morning and destroy them.</li>
    <li>Catch the larva in the early stages that are found in clusters and destroys them.</li>
    <li>In early stages flowers, infested pods and branched should be plucked and destroy
        them along with mahu.</li>
    <li class="lastli">If the insect menace has crossed economic loss level, use following
        insecticides:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>For control of Ara fly and haired larva, spray malathion 5% DP at the rate of 20-25
            kg per hectare or malathion 50% EC 1.50 liter or di chlorvas 76% EC 500 ml or quinolfos
            25% EC at the rate of 1.25 liter per hectare dissolved in approximately 600-750
            liter of water. </li>
        <li class="lastli">For control of Mahu, painted bugs and leaf borer insects, spray 1
            liter of di-methoate 30% EC or methyl-o-dematon 25% EC or chlorpyrifos 20% EC or
            monocrotofos 36% solution at the rate of 500 ml per hectare dissolved in approximately
            600-750 liter water. Azadirechtin (Neem oil) 0.15% EC can also be used at the rate
            of 2.5 liter per hectare. </li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>(B) Main Disease</strong></p><p>
    <strong>Alternaria Leaf Blight: </strong>
</p>
<p>
    In this disease, dark brown colored spot are formed on leaves and pods which clearly
    appear as ring shaped on the leaves. In case of intense menace, the spots are jointed.
    This burns the whole leaf.</p>
<p>
    <strong>White Gerui: </strong>
</p>
<p>
    White blisters are formed on the lower surface of the leaves because of which the
    leaves turn yellow in color and start drying. The florescence becomes distorted
    at flowering stage which results in no pod formation.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Control Measures </strong>
</p>
<ul class="number-list">
    <li class="lastli"><strong>Control Measures</strong><br>
        <ul>
            <li>For control of white gerui and tulasita disease, sow the seed after treatment with
                metalaxyl 35% WS at the rate of 2 gram per kg of seed.</li>
            <li class="lastli">For control of alternaria leaf blight, sow the seed after treatment
                with thiram 75% WS at the rate of 2.5 gram per kg of seed.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Soil Treatment:</strong><br>
        <p>
            For control of soil and seed borne diseases, mix the bio pesticides trichoderm biridi
            1% wp or trichoderma harzanium 2% wp at the rate of 2.5 kg per hectare with 60-75
            kg of rot farm yard manure, sprinkle light water on it and keep it in shade for
            8-10 days. Mix it in the soil at the time of last plough before sowing. This will
            help in management of seed/soil borne diseases of rye/ mustard.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li class="lastli"><strong>Foliar Treatment:</strong><br>
        <p>
            For control of alternaria leaf blight, white Gerui and tulasita disease, spray 2kg
            of mancozeb 75% WP or zineb 75% WP or zirum 80% WP or copper oxy chloride 50% wp
            at the rate of 3 kg per hectare dissolved in 600-750 liter of water.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>(C) Critical weeds</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Bathua, Santhi, Krishna neel, Hiran khuri, chatri-matri, Akra, forest carrot, gajri,
    pyaji, khartua, satyanaashi etc.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Control Measure </strong>
</p>
<div class="mini-list">
    <ul>
        <li>For weed control by weed herbicides, mix flucloralene 45% EC at the rte of 2.2 liter
            per hectare dissolved in approximately 800-1000 liter of water in the soil just
            before sowing or spray pendimethylene 30% EC at the rate of 3.3 liter per hectare
            dissolved in water as above through flat fan nozzle uniformly within 2-3 days of
            sowing.</li>
        <li class="lilast">If the weed herbicide has not been use, control the weeds by hoeing
            with hand hoe.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p>
    <strong>Harvesting and Threshing</strong>
</p>
<p>
    When the pods turn 75% golden in color, reap the crop and dry it. Thresh and separate
    the seed afterwards. If the harvesting is delayed, there is possibility of shredding
    of seeds. Store the seeds after drying well so that the grains are not adversely
    affected.</p>
