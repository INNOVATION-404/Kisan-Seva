<p>
    Cultivation of Kusum is more beneficial in the condition of limited irrigation.
    Primarily its cultivation is done in Bundelkhand. Farmers of eastern plains cultivate
    Kusum less as compared to other oilseed crops. Adoption of following improved methods
    result in growth in production and there by productivity.
</p><p>
    <strong>Preparation of Field</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Sow when the field is well prepared. For good germination, sow it in the field where
    moisture is sufficient.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Progressive Varieties</strong>
</p>
<p>
    K.65 is good variety of Kusum which ripens in180-190 days. Oil content in it is
    30-35% and average yield is 14-15 quintal per hectare. Its other variety is Kusum
    305 which ripens in 160 days. Oil content in it is 36%.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Seed Rate</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Use seed at the rate of 18-20 kg per hectare.</p><p>
    <strong>Sowing Time and Method</strong>
<p>
    Use seed at the rate of 18-20 kg per hectare.</p></p>
<p>
    Suitable time of sowing is between mid October to mid November. Sow it at a distance
    of 45 cm rows in furrows. After 15-20 days, remove extra plants so that distance
    between two plants becomes 20-25 days. Sow the seed at a depth of 3-4 cm.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Quantity of Fertilizer</strong>
</p><p>
    Use fertilizers on the basis of recommendations of soil testing. Use of 40 kg nitrogen
    and 20 kg phosphorous is more beneficial. Fertilizers should be used at a depth
    of 3-4 cm with the help of funnel (chonga) so that the crop can get maximum benefit
    of fertilizers.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Weeding and Hoeing</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Weed and hoe after 20-25 days of sowing. Remove un necessary plants and maintain
    the distance between 2 plants 20-25 cm.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Irrigation</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Often, it is cultivated in non-irrigated area. If means of irrigation is available,
    do 1 irrigation at the time of flowering.</p>
<h4>
    <strong>Crop Protection</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    Some times, the standing crop is affected by Gerui disease and mhu insect which
    cause heavy damage to the crop. Hence it should be controlled as per following method:</p>
<div class="number-list">
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Diagnosis of Gerui Disease</strong>
            <p>
                Yellow or brown blisters appear on the leaves.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Treatment</strong></p>
            <p>
                For control of this disease, spray mancojeb 75% WP 2 kg or Zineb 75% 2.5 kg per
                hectare dissolved in 800-1000 liter water 3-4 times at an interval 10-14 days.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Jhulsa Disease</strong>
            <p>
                Symptoms and do treatment as in rye/mustard.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="lastli"><strong>Diagnosis of Mahu Insect</strong>
            <p>
                This insect is black in color which is found stick on flowers/leaves/soft shoots
                in cluster. It sucks the juice and damages it.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Treatment </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Spray any one of the following insecticides for protection from these insects and
                repeat it at an interval of 15-20 days if required. Spray Malathion 50 EC 2 liter
                per hectare or monochrotofos solution 1.o liter per hectare or methyl-o-dematon
                25% EC at the 1.o liter per hectare.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p>
    <strong>Harvesting and Threshing </strong>
</p>
<p>
    When the crop is ripened, the leaves turn yellow. Then reap it and separate the
    grains by threshing.
