        <b> RYE AND MUSTARD</b>
    </h1>
</head>
<body>
<p>
    Rye/mustard has important place in Rabi oilseed crops. After numerous efforts, there
    is no significant increase the area of rye cultivation. The main reason behind this
    is increase in area of other important crops with increase in irrigation capacity.
    Its cultivation is more beneficial in case of limited irrigation. Adoption of progressive
    methods results in increase in production and productivity.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Preparation of Field </strong>
</p>
<p>
    First plough is to done by disc harrow followed by use of leveler to make the soil
    fine. If the moisture content is field is low, prepare the field by tillage. The
    field is well prepared by use of tractor driven rotavator.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Seed Rate </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Use 5-6 kg per hectare seed in irrigated/non-irrigated area.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Seed Treatment</strong>
</p>
<p>
    For control of seed borne diseases, sow the seeds after treatment with thiram at
    the rte of 2.5 gm per kg seed. Treatment with metalaxyl at the rate of 1.5 gm per
    hectare controls the white gerui and tulasita disease in early stage.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Sowing time and Sowing Method </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Suitable time of sowing of rye in Bundel khand and Agra division is last week of
    September and in remaining area, it is first fortnight of October. Seed should be
    sown at a distance of 45 cm in shallow furrows (4-5 cm deep) behind local plough.
    Use light leveler after sowing to cover the seed. In non-irrigated condition, suitable
    time of sowing is second fortnight of September. In case of late sowing, there is
    higher possibility of menace of mahu and other insects and diseases.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Quantity of Fertilizer</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Use fertilizers on the basis of recommendations of soil testing. In irrigated area,
    good yield can be obtained by use of 120 kg nitrogen, 60 kg phosphate and 60 kg
    potash per hectare. Use of phosphorus as single super phosphate is more beneficial
    because it also ensures availability of sulphur. If single super phosphate is not
    used, sulphur at the rate of 40 kg per hectare should be used. In non irrigated
    areas half of the quantity of above fertilizer should be used as basal dressing.
    If DAP is used, use of 200 kg of gypsum per hectare at the time of sowing is beneficial
    for the crop and to get good yield, rot farm yard manure at the rate of 60 kg per
    hectare used be used.
</p>
<p>
    In irrigated areas, at the time of sowing, half of the quantity of nitrogen and
    full quantity of phosphate and potash should be given 2-3 cm below the seeds in
    furrows by funnel (chonga). Remaining quantity of nitrogen should be used at the
    time of first irrigation (after 25-30 days of sowing) as top dressing.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Weeding- Hoeing and Thinning </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Keep the distance between 2 plants as 15 cm by uprooting dense plants within 15-20
    days of sowing. To destroy the weeds, first hoeing should be done before irrigation
    and second hoeing after first irrigation. For chemical control of weeds, spray fluchloroline
    45 EC at the rate of 2.2 liter per hectare dissolved in 800-1000 liter of water
    and mix it well in the soil by using harrow or spray pendimethylene 30 EC uniformly
    at the rate of 3.3 liter per hectare dissolved in 800-1000 liter of water within
    2-3 days of sowing.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Irrigation </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Rye is more susceptible to the deficiency of moisture at the time of flowering and
    grain formation. Hence to get good yield, irrigation is essential at this stage.
    If the fertilizers is to be used in higher quantity (120 kg of nitrogen, 60 kg of
    phosphate and 60 kg of potash per hectare) and if the soil is light twice irrigation,
    first after 30-35 days of sowing and second after 55-65 days of sowing, when there
    is no rain, should be done to get good yield.

    <strong>(b) Main Disease</strong></h4>
<div class="number-list">
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Alternaria Leaf Blight</strong>
            <br>
            <p>
                In this disease, dark brown colored spot are formed on leaves and pods which clearly
                appear as ring shaped on the leaves. In case of intense menace, the spots are jointed.
                This burns the whole leaf.</p></li>
        <li><strong>White Gerui</strong>
            <br>
            <p>
                White blisters are formed on the lower surface of the leaves. Because of which the
                leaves turn yellow in color and start drying. The florescence becomes distorted
                at flowering stage which results in no pod formation.</p></li>
        <li class="lastli"><strong>Tulasita Disease</strong>
            <br>
            <p>
                In this disease, a small spots appear on the upper surface of older leaves and white
                haired fungus grows on lower surface of the leaves. Slowly the whole leaves turn

<div class="number-list">
    <ul>
        <li>For weed control by weed herbicides, mix flucloralene 45% EC at the rte of 2.2 liter

    </ul>
</div>
<p>
    <strong>Harvesting and Threshing </strong>
</p>
<p>
    When the pods turn 75% golden in color, reap the crop and dry it. Thresh and separate
    the seed afterwards. If the harvesting is delayed, there is possibility of shredding
    of seeds. Store the seeds after drying well so that the grains are not adversely
    affected.
