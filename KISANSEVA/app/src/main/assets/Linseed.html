    <strong>Preparation of Field</strong>
</p><p>
    Cultivation of alsi can successfully be done in mud clay (matyar) and loamy soil.
    After harvesting Kharif crop, one plough should be done by disc harrow. Then after,
    use cultivator or local plough twice and level the field well.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Sowing Time </strong>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
    Suitable time of sowing is last week of October to first week of November.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Seed Rate </strong>
</p>
<p>
    30 kg per hectare for seed purpose and 50 kg per hectare seed for dual purpose is
    required.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Distance </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Distance between furrows to furrows should be 25 cm for variety of seed purpose
    and 20 cm for dual purpose seed.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Seed Treatment</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Infestation of Jhulsa and Ukatha is caused by both seed and soil in early stage
    in Alsi crop. From protection of it, sow the seed after treatment with 2.5 gm thiram
    or 2 gm carbandazim per kg seed.

    <strong>(A) Main Insects </strong>
</p>
<div class="number-list">
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Gallmiz </strong>
            <br>
            <p>
                Maggot of this insect enters the blooming buds and eats androecia due to which grains
                are not formed.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="lastli"><strong>Haired Larva </strong>
            <br>
            <p>
                The larva is black and orange in color and the whole body is covered with hair.
                In early stage, the larva lives in cluster and eats the leaves and spread in the
                whole field afterwards and eat the leaves. . In case of intense menace, the whole
                plant becomes leaf less.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p>
    <strong>Control Measures</strong>
</p>
<div class="number-list">
    <ul>
        <li>Deep plough in summers. </li>
        <li>Use balanced fertilizers. </li>
        <li>For control of gall miz, resistant variety such as Neelam, Garima, Sweta should
            be sown.</li>
        <li>Sowing till 3rd week of September reduces the menace of gall miz.</li>
        <li>Mix cropping with gram, rye/ mustard and Kusum also reduces the menace of gall miz.</li>
        <li class="lastli">If the insect menace has crossed economic loss level, use following
            insecticides:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>For control of gol miz and haired larva, spray methyl-o-dematon 25% EC 1 or monochrotofos
                36 % solution at the rate of 1.0 liter per hectare dissolved in 600-750 liter water.</li>
            <li class="lastli">For control of haired larva, spray malathion 5% DP at the rate of
                20-25 kg per hectare or malathion 50% EC 1.50 liter or di chlorvas 76% EC 500 ml
                or quinolfos 25% EC at the rate of 1.25 liter per hectare dissolved in approximately
                600-750 liter of water.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

<h4>
    <strong>(B) Critical Disease </strong>
</h4>
<div class="number-list">
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ukatha </strong>
            <br>
            <p>
                Infested leaves of the plants start turning yellow from bottom to up and the whole
                plant dry afterwards.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Alternaria Leaf Blight </strong>
            <br>
            <p>
                In this disease, dark brown colored spot are formed on leaves and pods which clearly
                appear as ring shaped on the leaves. In case of intense menace, the spots are jointed.
                This burns the whole leaf. This disease also affects the stem, branches, shoots
                and pods. In case of intense menace, pods turn black in color and die.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Gerui </strong>
            <br>
            <p>
                White blisters are formed on the lower surface of the leaves because of which the
                leaves turn yellow in color and start drying.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="lastli"><strong>Powdery Mildew</strong>
            <br>
            <p>
                In this disease, white powder appears on the leaf due to which the leaves become
                dry.</p>
        </li>

<p>
    <strong>Control Measures</strong>
</p>
<div class="number-list">
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Seed Treatment:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>For control of Ukatha disease, sow the seed after treatment with 1% triderma viridi/trichoderma
                    harzianum 2% WP at the rate of 4 gram per kg of seed.</li>
                <li class="lastli">For control of alternaria leaf blight, sow the seed after treatment

                    hectare with 60-75 kg of rot farm yard manure, sprinkle light water on it and keep
                    it in shade for 8-10 days. Mix it in the soil at the time of last plough before
                    sowing. This will help in management of seed/soil borne diseases. </li>
            </ul>

                <li class="lastli">For control of powdery mildew, spary soluble sulphur 80% WP at the
                    rate of 2.50 kg per hectare dissolved in 600-750 liter of water.</li>
            </ul>

    pyaji, khartua, satyanaashi etc.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Control Measures </strong>
</p>
<p>
    For weed control, spray uniformaly pendimethylene 30% Ec at the rate of 3.30 liter
    per hectare dissolved in 800-1000 liter water within 2-3 days of sowing through
    flat fan nozzle.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Important Points </strong>
</p>
<div class="mini-list">
    <ul>
        <li>Use certified seeds of recommended variety.</li>
        <li>Use fertilizers in balanced quantity.</li>
        <li>If the irrigation facility is available, must irrigate at the time of flowering.
        </li>
        <li class="lilast">For control of gal miz, spray any one insecticide at the time of
