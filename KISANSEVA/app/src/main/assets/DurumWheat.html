    In India, cultivation of Kathia Wheat is done in approximately 25 lakh hectare area.
    Mainly, tropical climatic areas of middle and south India comes under it. Kathia
    wheat is the second level important wheat of Triticum family in India. In all the
    three sub-families of wheat (Astium, Durum and Cocum), kathia wheat is placed at
    second position in respect to wheat sown area and production. Its cultivation is
    very old in India. In earlier days, it was mostly grown in Punjab of north-west
    India, followed by Karnataka in south India and then after it spread from east to
    west Bengal.
</p>
<p>
    Cultivation of Kathia wheat was often done in rain fed (un-irrigated) area. Hence
    the yield was un- certain and this variety was grown in disease infested area, low
    fertilizer retaining capacity and limited area. Today, nature has provided unlimited
    potential of Kathia wheat production in middle India. Quality wheat can be grown
    in Malawanchal of Middle India, Saurashtra and Kathiawar of Gujarat, Kota, Malwad
    and Udaipur of Rajasthan and Bundelkhand in Uttar Pradesh. Kathia wheat is supposed
    to be good for commercial use. Semolina derived from it is used in manufacturing
    of easily digestible food such as Pizza, Spaghetti, Sewai, Noodles, Worm celli etc.
    Due to disease resistance capacity, its possibility of export is higher.

<h4>
    <strong>Benefits from cultivation of Kathia Wheat</strong>
</h4>
<div class="mini-list bott_margin">
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Less Irrigation- </strong>Variety of Kathia wheat is draught resistant.
            Hence 3 times irrigation is sufficient which yields 45-50 quintal per hectare.</li>
        <li><strong>High Production- </strong>In case of irrigated condition, the average yield
            of Kathia variety is 50-60 quintal per hectare where as in non-irrigated and rain
            fed conditions, the average yield is 30-35 quintal per hectare.</li>
        <li><strong>Sufficient Nutritive Element- </strong>Kathia variety not only provided
            food security but of nutritive elements, the protein content is 1.5- 2.0% higher
            than Astivum, higher content of Vitamin ‘A’ and Beta Carotene and Gluten is found
            in sufficient quantity.</li>
        <li class="lastLi"><strong>Crop Security- </strong>In Kathia wheat, menace of Gerui
            or Ratua disease is found less or more as per temperature. New variety6 can be grown
            to reduce its effect.</li>

<p>
    <strong>Quantity of Fertilizer</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Use of balanced fertilizers and manures is essential for best quality of seeds and
    good yield. Hence 120 kg nitrogen (half of the quantity with plough), 60 kg phosphorous
    and 30 kg potash per hectare is sufficient in irrigated condition. Use half of the
    quantity of nitrogen after irrigation as top dressing. Use nitrogen, phosphorous
    and potash in the ratio of 60:30:15 in non- irrigated condition and 80:40:20 in
    half irrigated condition.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Sowing</strong>
</p>
<p>
    In un-irrigated conditions, wheat must be sown from last week of October to first
    week of November. In irrigated conditions, second and third week of November is
    the best the best time of sowing.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Irrigation</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Do irrigation as per requirement. 2-3 times irrigation in un-irrigated condition
    and 3 times irrigation in irrigated condition are sufficient.

    <strong>Crop Protection</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Use weed herbicides and disease resistant chemicals as in normal wheat.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Harvesting</strong>
</p>
<p>
    There is possibility of falling Kathia wheat. Hence early harvesting and threshing
    should be done when the crop is ripened.

    <strong>Important Point for successful cultivation of Kathia wheat </strong>
</p>
<div class="mini-list bott_margin">
    <ul>
        <li>Timely sowing is essential for good yield.</li>
        <li>In non-irrigated and half irrigated condition, sufficient moisture is essential
            at the time of sowing.</li>
        <li>Sow the seed by selecting recommended variety of Kathia wheat taken from seed sale
            center.</li>
        <li>At the time of ripening, low moisture content is required for shining grains.</li>
        <li class="lastLi">Use least quantity of disease and insecticides so that the quality
            of grains is not affected.</li>
