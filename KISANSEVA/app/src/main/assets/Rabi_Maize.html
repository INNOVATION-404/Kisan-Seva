        <b> RABI MAIZE</b>
    </h1>
</head>
<body>
<p>
    Cultivation of maize is done in north/eastern plain areas. In other irrigated areas
    of the state also, its cultivation can be done successfully.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Preparation of Field</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Loamy soil is suitable for rabi maize. Make the soil fine by 1-2 plough by disc
    harrow. If there is lack of sufficient moisture, prepare the field by tillage. By
    use of tractor driven rotavator, the field is prepared in single plough.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Sowing Time</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Suitable time of sowing of Rabi maize is 15th October to 15th November.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Seed Rate and Sowing Method</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Use 20-22 kg seed per hectare for Rabi maize so that 85-90 thousand plants can be
    obtained. Treatment of seed before sowing is essential. Keep the distance between
    2 rows 60 cm and between 2 plants 20-25 cm.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Seed Treatment</strong>
</p>
<p>
    For protection of seed borne diseases, sow the seed after treatment with 2.5 gm
    thiram or 2 gm carbadasim 50% per hectare.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Fertilizers</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Use of fertilizer as follows is beneficial according to the variety of maize sown
    and soil testing:</p>

<p>
    Whole quantity of phosphorous and potash and 1/4th quantity of nitrogen should be
    used at the time of sowing. Half of the remaining quantity of nitrogen should be
    used when the plants attain knee height and remaining quantity should be used as
    top dressing before silk formation. In the areas of zinc deficiency, use 20-25 kg
    zinc sulphate per hectare before last plough. Never use zinc sulphate with phosphate
    fertilizer. To get good yield and maintain the soil fertility, use 60 quintal per
    hectare well decomposed cow dung or compost for hybrid variety and 4o kg for sankul
    variety. In such condition, 20 kg less nitrogen per hectare should be used.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Other Necessary Activities</strong>
</p>
<p>
    When the crop attains knee height, earth up the plants. A drain is formed between
    the rows of the plants by this activity due to which irrigation becomes easier.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Weeding-Hoeing</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Take out weeds and hoe after 20-25 days and 40-45 days of sowing or spray atrazine
    50% WP 1.0-1.5 liter dissolved in 500-600 liter water before sowing and after germination.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Irrigation</strong>
</p><p>
    Rabi maize requires 4-5 irrigation. First irrigation should be done after 25-30
    days of sowing, second after 55-60 days, third after 75-80 days, fourth after 110-115
    days and fifth after 120-125 days. If required, additional irrigation as per moisture
    requirement of the field will be suitable.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Inter Cropping</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Early ripening variety of pulses such as peas (for vegetables), Rajma, Wakla, tomato,
    early potato, carrot, sweet carrot and onion can be sown between the rows as inter
    crop successfully.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Harvesting</strong>
</p>
<p>
    When 75% of the leaves covering the cobs turns yellow, pluck the cobs, dry it and
    separate the kernels.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Maize Saylor</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Dry the corn and sail the kernels by manual or power driven maize sailor. It reduces
    the cost by 40-50%.
