        <b> GRAM</b>
    </h1>
</head>
<body>
<p>
    In pulse crops, gram has an important place. Attention should be given on following points to take more yields:</p>
<p>
    <strong>Land: </strong>
</p>
<p>
    For cultivation of gram, loam or heavy loam, maar and pandua soil in which proper arrangement for water drainage is available are suitable. </p>
<p>
    <strong>Preparation of Land </strong>
</p>
<p>
    First plough, 6 cm deep, should be done by disc harrow followed by 2 plough by local plough or cultivator and use leveler to prepare the field.
</p><p>
    <strong>Seed Rate </strong>
</p>
<p>
    For grains of small size, 75-80 kg and large size 90-100 kg seed per hectare is required.</p>
<h4>
    <strong>Seed Treatment </strong>
</h4>
<p>
    <strong>A-	Seed treatment by Rhizobium Culture </strong>
</p>
<p>
    For different pulse crop, different Rhizobium culture is used. For gram, mesorhizobium siseri culture is used. One packet (200 gm) culture is sufficient for treatment of 10 kg seed. Pour 10 kg seed in a bucket and mix well so that culture is applied on every seed. The seeds so mixed with rhizobium culture should be dried in shade for some time.</p>
<p>
    <strong>B-	Must use P.S.B culture</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Precaution </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Do not dry seeds in sun light after treatment and as for as possible, the seeds should be treated in after noon so that the seed can be sown in the evening or next morning.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Seed Treatment </strong>
</p>
<p>
    From protection from seed borne disease, treat the seed with thiram 2 gm or mancozeb 3gm or trichoderma 4 gm or thiram 2gm+carbandzim 1 gm per kg before sowing. Seed should be treated before its treatment with culture.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Sowing </strong>
</p>
<p>
    In case of non irrigated condition, gram should be sown till second or third week of October. In case of irrigated condition, the gram should be sown till 2nd week of November and late crop can be sown up to 1st week of December. The seed should be sown at a depth of 6-8 cm in furrows behind the plough. Furrows to furrows distance should be 30 cm in case of non irrigated and late sown condition where as it should be 45 cm in irrigated and kabar or maar soil.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Fertilizer</strong>
</p>
<p>
    For all varieties, use 20 kg nitrogen, 60 kg phosphorous, 20 kg potash and 20 kg sulphur per hectare in furrows. Use of fertilizer on the basis of recommendations is more beneficial. Spray 2% urea solution at the time of flowering in non irrigated and late sown conditions.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Irrigation </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Apply first irrigation after 45-60 days (before flowering) as per need and second at the time of grain formation in the pods. If there is rain in winter season, second irrigation is not required. Do not irrigate at the time of flowering otherwise it may harm instead of profit. </p>

    <strong>(A) Main Insects</strong>
</p>
<div class="number-list">
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Katua Insect</strong><br>
            Brown colored maggot of this insect comes out in the night and cuts the plant at
            the surface as a result the plants fall.</li>
        <li><strong>Semi Looper Insect</strong><br>
            The maggot of this insect is green in color which walks in loop. The maggots eat
            the leaves, soft twigs, buds, flowers and pods and harm them.</li>
        <li class="lastli"><strong>Fruit Borer Insect</strong><br>
            The maggot of this insect is green or brown in color. Generally, a long line on
            the back and thin long line is found on both the sides. In early stage, the infant
            maggots scratch the soft leaves and eat them and when they become adult, bore the
            pods and eat the pod. A maggot can affect 30-40 grains in his life span. In case
            of intense menace, the pods become hollow and production is heavily affected.</li>

    <strong>(B) Critical Disease</strong>
</p>
<div class="number-list">
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Root Rot:</strong><br>
            After 15-20 days of sowing, the plants start drying. If the plant is uprooted and
            seen, cotton like fungus is seen on the stem. This is called early root rot. The
            menace of this disease generally appears from October to November. In late root
            rot, the stem of the plants blacken and rot. The menace of this disease appears
            more from February to March. </li>
        <li><strong>Ukatha: </strong>
            <br>
            The plants slowly start wilting and dry. If the plant is uprooted and seen, its
            root and stem is found well. The bark becomes brown in color and if the root is
            cut vertically, black colored veins are seen. Ukatha can infest the plant at any
            stage. </li>
        <li class="lastli"><strong>Eschochita Leaf Blight Disease: </strong>
            <br>
            In this disease, dark grey colored spots appear on the leaves and pod. In favorable
            conditions, the spots join together as a result the whole leaf is burnt.</li>

    <strong>Control Measures</strong>
</p>
<div class="number-list">
    <ul>
        <li class="lastli"><strong>Cultivation Activity </strong>
            <ul>
                <li>In summers, plough by disc harrow helps in control of soil borne diseases.</li>
                <li>Do not take the gram crop in the field for 3-4 years which is often infested by
                    Ukatha.</li>
                <li>Sow in the second week of November for prevention of early root rot.</li>
                <li class="lastli">For protection from Ukatha disease, sow disease resistant and KWR

        <li class="lastli"><strong>Seed Treatment </strong>
            <p>
                For control of seed borne diseases, sow the seed after treatment with thiram 75%+carbandasim
                50%(2:1) 3.0 gm or trichoderma 4.0 gm per kg seed.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li class="lastli"><strong>Soil Treatment </strong>
            <p>
                For control of seed and soil borne diseases, mix the bio pesticides trichoderma
                viridi 1% WP or trichoderma harzianum 2% WP at the rate of 2.5 kg per hectare with
                60-75 kg decomposed dung manure, sprinkle light water on it and keep it for 8-10
                days in the shade. Spread the mixture at the time of last plough before sowing.
                This will help in control of seed/soil borne diseases in gram.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="lastli"><strong>Foliar Treatment</strong>
            <p>
                For eschochita leaf blight disease, spray mancozeb 75% WP 2.0 kg or copper oxy chloride
                50% WP 3.0 kg per hectare dissolved in approximately 500-600 liter water.</p>

    <strong>Control Measures</strong>
</p>
<div class="number-list">
    <ul>
        <li>For weed control by weed herbicide chemicals, spread fluchloralin 45% EC, 2.2 liter

    </ul>
</div>
<p>
    <strong>Harvesting and Storage</strong>
</p>
<p>
    When the pods are ripened, harvest and thresh it. Since pulses are easily affected,
    store it when it is well dried. For protection from insects in storage, use 2 tablets
    of aluminium phosphide per hectare.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Important Point</strong>
</p>
<div class="mini-list">
    <ul>
        <li>Use certified and pure seed by selecting variety as per regional adoptability.</li>
        <li>Use phosphorous bearing fertilizers in furrows as basal dressing as per recommendation.</li>
        <li>Proper control/treatment of diseases and fruit borer insects by taking timely knowledge.</li>
        <li>Supply sulphur in the form of pyrite/gypsum/single super phosphate.</li>
        <li>Must treat the seed.</li>
        <li>Do not irrigate at the time of flowering.</li>
        <li>For late sowing, use early ripening variety. </li>
        <li>Spray 2% borax in kabuli chana.</li>
        <li>Timely control of insects and diseases.</li>
        <li>Sow the gram from North to South.</li>
        <li class="lilast">In non irrigated condition, spray of 2% urea at the time of flowering
            is beneficial.</li>
