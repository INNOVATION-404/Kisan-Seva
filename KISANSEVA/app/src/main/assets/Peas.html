    <strong>Land: </strong>
    <br>
    Loam and light loam soil is suitable for peas.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Preparation of Land: </strong>
    <br>
    First plough should be done by disc harrow and subsequent 2 â€“ 3 plough by local plough or cultivator.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Quantity of Seed </strong>
</p>
<p>
    80-100 kg seed per hectare for long variety and 125 kg seed for dwarf variety is required.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Seed Treatment </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Rhizobium leguminoserum culture is used foe pea.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Sowing</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Sowing should be done at a distance of 20cm (dwarf) and 30 cm for long variety behind the plough from mid October to mid November. Pea is sown by Pant Nagar Zero Till Drill.


</p>
<p>
    <strong>Seed Treatment</strong>
</p>
<p>
    For protection from seed borne diseases, treat the seed before sowing with thiram 2 gm or mancozeb 3 gm or 4 gm trichoderma or thiram 2 gm + carbandasim 1gm per kg seed.


</p>
<p>
    Seed should be treated before its treatment with culture. Sow the seed after treatment of 10 kg seed with 1 packet (200 gm) rhizobium culture.PSB culture must be used.</p>

<p>
    For dwarf variety, give 20 kg extra nitrogen at the time of sowing.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Irrigation </strong>
</p>
<p>
    If there is no rain in winter, apply 1 irrigation at the time of flowering. Second irrigation is beneficial at the time of grain formation. Sprinkler irrigation will be beneficial in Bundelkhand.

<div class="number-list">
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Shoot Fly:</strong>
            <br>
            The maggot of this insect lives in the stem and eat it as a result the stem swells.
            In case of intense mence, the plant turns yellow and dry. </li>
        <li><strong>Semilooper Insect:</strong>
            <br>
            The maggot of this insect is green in color which moves in loop. The maggots eat
            leaves, soft twigs, buds, flowers and pod and harm it.</li>
        <li><strong>Leaf Borer Insect:</strong>
            <br>
            The maggot of this insect bores the leaves and eats the green part as a result the
            leaves become irregular shaped and white lines appears on it. </li>
        <li class="lastli"><strong>Pod Borer Insect: </strong>
            <br>
            The maggots of this insect are flat and green in color which enter the pod by boring
            it and eats the grain inside. In case of intense menace, the pods become hollow
            and production falls.</li>

    <strong>Control Measure </strong>
</p>
<div class="number-list">
    <ul>

            of the following insecticides:-</li>
        <ul>
            <li>For control of shoot fly and leaf borer insect, mix in the soil carbofuran 3 CG
                15 kg or forret 10 G at the rate of 10 kg per hectare before sowing. For insect

    <strong>(B) Critical Disease</strong>
</p>
<div class="number-list">
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ukatha:</strong>
            <br>
            The plants slowly start wilting and dry. If the plant is uprooted and seen, its
            root and stem is found well. The bark becomes brown in color and if the root is
            cut vertically, black colored veins are seen. Ukatha can infest the plant at any
            stage. </li>
        <li><strong>Alternaria Leaf Blight Disease:</strong>
            <br>
            In this disease, ring shaped spots appear on the leaves. In favorable conditions,
            the spots join together as a result the whole leaf is burnt.</li>
        <li><strong>Powdery Mildew (Bukni):</strong>
            <br>
            In this disease, white powder is seen on leaf, stems and pods. The leaves dry and
            fall afterward.</li>
        <li class="lastli"><strong>Mradul Romil( Tulasita): </strong>
            <br>
            In this disease, small spots on the upper side of leaf and white furred fungus on
            below the spots on the lower side of the leaves grow. Slowly the leaves turn yellow
            and fall. In the same way, the spot appears on the pods also and fungus similar
            to cotton grows below that spot as a result, grain is not formed in the pods.</li>

    <strong>Control Measures </strong>
</p>
<div class="number-list">
    <ul>
        <li class="lastli"><strong>Cultivation Activities </strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>In summers, plough by disc harrow helps in control of soil borne diseases.</li>
            <li>Do not take the pea crop in the field for 3-4 years which is often infested by Ukatha.</li>
            <li>For protection from Ukatha disease, sow disease resistant variety.</li>
            <li class="lastli">For protection from Powdery Mildew (Bukni) disease, sow disease resistant
                variety such as Rachna, Pant matar-5, Malviya matar-2 etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <li class="lastli"><strong>Seed Treatment </strong></li>
        <p>
            For control of seed borne diseases, sow the seed after treatment with thiram 75%+carbandasim
            50% (2:1) 3.0 gm or trichoderma 4.0 gm per kg seed.
        </p>
        <li class="lastli"><strong>Soil Treatment </strong></li>
        <p>
            For control of seed and soil borne diseases, mix the bio pesticides trichoderma
            viridi 1% WP or trichoderma harzianum 2% WP at the rate of 2.5 kg per hectare with
            60-75 kg decomposed dung manure, sprinkle light water on it and keep it for 8-10
            days in the shade. Spread the mixture at the time of last plough before sowing.
            This controls the seed/soil borne diseases in peas.</p>
        <li class="lastli"><strong>Foliar Treatment </strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>For control of alternaria leaf blight and tulasita disease, spray mancozeb 75% WP
                2.0 kg or zineb 75% WP 2.0 kg or copper oxy chloride 50% WP 3.0 kg per hectare dissolved
                in approximately 500-600 liter water.</li>
            <li class="lastli">For control of powdery mildew, spray soluble sulphur 80% 2 kg or
                tridemorph 80% EC 500 ml per hectare dissolved in 500-600 liter water.</li>

    pyaji, khartua, satyanaashi etc.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Control Measures</strong>
</p>
<div class="number-list">
    <ul>
        <li>For weed control by weed herbicide chemicals, spread in the soil fluchloralin 45%
            EC, 2.2 liter per hectare dissolved in approximately 800-1000 liter water before
            sowing or spray pendimethylene 30%, 3.30 liter or alochlor 50% EC uniformly at the
            rate of 4.0 liter per hectare dissolved in water as above through flat fan/nozzle
            within 2-3 days of sowing. </li>
        <li class="lastli">If weed herbicides has not been used, hoe by hand hoe to control
            the weeds.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p>
    <strong>Harvesting and Storage</strong></p>
<p>
    Harvest the crop when it is fully ripened. Thresh it in a clean field and take out
    the grains. Use aluminium phosphide at the rate of 3 tablets per ton for protection
    from storage insects.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Important Points </strong>
</p>
<div class="number-list">
    <ul>
        <li>Select the variety as per regional adoptability and sow certified seed.</li>
        <li>Sow in time.</li>
        <li>Use single super phosphate for phosphorous and sulphur.</li>
        <li>Spray 0.1% zinc sulphate for control of Ratua.</li>
        <li class="lastli">For early ripening variety, ensure 6.6 lakh(15x10 cm) per hectare
            plants for more yield.</li>
