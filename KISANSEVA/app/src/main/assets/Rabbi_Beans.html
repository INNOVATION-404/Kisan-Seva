<p>
    The cultivation of rajma in Rabi season is prevalent in plains in last few years.
    The statistics of area under cultivation and production is nor available as of date.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Land </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Loam and light loam soil is more suitable. There should be proper arrangement of
    water drainage.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Preparation of Land</strong>
</p>
<p>
    For preparation of filed, by first plough by disc harrow followed by 2-3 plough
    by local harrow or cultivator is cultivator is required. Adequate moisture at the
    time of sowing is essential.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Quantity of seed</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Sow 120 -140 kg per hectare of seeds, the distance between the rows should be 30-40
    cm and the gap between the plants should be 10 cm. sow the seeds at a depth of 8
    to 10 cm after treatment with thiram so that it can get sufficient moisture.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Sowing</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The third and the fourth week of October are suitable for sowing. In the Eastern
    areas, sowing can be done in first week of November. Sowing after this can reduce
    the production.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Fertilizers</strong>
</p>
<p>
    As the rajma do not have rhizobium glands, it required more quantity of nitrogen.
    Use of 120 kg of nitrogen, 60 kg of phosphate and 30 kg of potash per hectare is
    essential. 60 kg of nitrogen and full quantity of phosphate and potash should be
    spread at the time of sowing and remaining quantity of nitrogen should be given
    as top dressing. Sulphur at the rate of 20 kg per hectare gives good results. Spray
    of 20% urea solution on 30th and 50th days increases the yield of rajma.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Irrigation</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Rajma needs irrigation for 2 – 3 times. Apply first irrigation after four weeks
    of sowing. Later irrigate at an interval of one month. Light irrigation is required
    so that the water is not logged in the field.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Weeding – Hoeing </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Weeding and hoeing should be done after first irrigation. At the time of hoeing,
    earth up some soil on the plant so that it can support the plant at the time of
    pod formation. Pending methylene can be spread at the rate of 3.3 liter per hectare
    to controls the weeds.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Seed Treatment </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Treatment of seeds with suitable fungicide such as carbandasim or thiram at the
    rate of 2 gram per kg will prevent the menace of disease at the time of germination.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Disease Control</strong></p>
<p>
    When the mosaic appears on the leaves, spray of dimethoate 30% EC 1 liter or 250
    ml of imidacloprid 17.8% solution, dissolved in 500-600 liter of water controls
    the white flies as a result the disease does not spread. Uproot the infested plant
    to prevent disease.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Harvesting and Storage </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Reap the crop when the parts are ripened. Excessive dryness can results into bursting
    of pods. Grains are taken out by threshing.
